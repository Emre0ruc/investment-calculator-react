# Investment Calculator (React)

This repository contains my solution to a practice assignment from the course:

"Dive in and learn React.js from scratch! Learn React, Hooks, Redux, React Router, Next.js, Best Practices and more" by Maximilian Schwarzm√ºller.

I implemented this project myself as part of the course exercises.  
The project allows users to enter investment details and calculates investment growth over time, displaying the results in a table format.
